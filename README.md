# Put Hermit Lite App APKs in your App Drawer

Hermit includes support for launching Lite Apps from an APK (in addition to putting a shortcut icon on your home screen).

Now you can have Hermit Lite Apps in your App Drawer as well!

## Getting Started

1.  Use this example project as a template: [github.com/chimbori/hermit-lite-app-example](https://github.com/chimbori/hermit-lite-app-example).

1.  Clone the downloaded repo to your local machine, then open the downloaded project in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

1.  Change the `applicationId`, since every app must have a unique one.

    - Open `liteapp/build.gradle`, and change the following line. Usually, this is a domain name you control, with each segment in reverse order, like the example above.
      ```
      applicationId "org.example.liteapp"
      ```

1.  Change the Lite App Name and URL to anything you want.

    - In the same file, change the following lines:
      ```
      resValue("string", "start_url", "https://example.org/")
      resValue("string", "app_name", "Lite App Example")
      ```

1. Change the icon to a custom 512Ã—512 icon: `liteapp/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi`

1. Compile the project and run. Then generate an APK and copy it to your phone.
